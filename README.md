# News Application – React Final Project

## About the Project

This application represents the final project developed as part of the Web Development React Course at ITSchool Romania.

The project is a News Application built with React, which displays news articles from multiple categories such as Sports, Science, Environment, Business, and more. The application fetches data from The Guardian API and presents it in a clean and intuitive interface.

The homepage displays a list of news articles, while each category has its own dedicated page. To enhance performance and user experience, pagination is implemented so that articles are loaded and displayed in batches rather than all at once.

State management is handled using the React Context API, allowing data to be shared efficiently across components. Users can view articles by category, access a detailed page for each news item, and manage a list of favorite articles.

Each news card includes a Favorites button that allows users to add or remove articles from their favorites list. All saved articles are displayed on a dedicated Favorites page.

The application layout includes a header with the ITSchool logo and navigation links (Football, Science, Environment, Business, Favorites), as well as a footer containing information about ITSchool Romania.
